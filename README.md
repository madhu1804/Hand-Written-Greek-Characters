# Hand-Written-Greek-Characters


Objective:

For the categorization of Greek recognition in this project, I built and put into practice a number of machines learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbour, Ensemble, and Tree. As a feature, I used a feature extractor in MATLAB to influence the HOG feature on binary picture data in vector form. By calculating the accuracy for the test and training data and representing the accuracy for various methods on the same figure for the feature as vector form without PCA and with PCA and HOG feature, one can evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithm. As a result, there are three methods available to determine how well the algorithm performs given the input characteristic. We have first design the machine learning model for the recognition of the digit using Ensemble, KNN, SVM and Decision Tree classifier, by the training and testing we get accuracy greater than 98% which is great there are 2% or lesser chances getting the wrong prediction.

Introduction:

In this project I am going to design and implement various machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machining, k-Nearest Neighbour, Ensemble and Tree for the classification of Digit recognition. I am going to use feature as the binary image data in vector form and using the HOG feature using feature extractor in MATLAB. Determining the performance of the Machine learning algorithm by computing the accuracy for the test and training data and representation of the accuracy for different method on the same figure for the feature as vector form without PCA and with PCA and HOG feature. So here there are three strategies to get the performance of the algorithm based on the input feature.
	A branch of computing algorithms called machine learning is constantly developing and aims to replicate human intelligence by learning from the environment. The issue of creating computers that learn automatically through use is addressed by machine learning. The junction of computer science and statistics, as well as the foundation of artificial intelligence and data science, make it one of the technical domains with the fastest growth rates today. This covers theoretical advancements in machine learning (ML) inspired by physical insights, as well as the application of ML methods to a variety of fields such as picture and speech recognition, traffic prediction, self-driving cars, and many more. OCR is also known as Optical Character Recognition is an algorithm used to identify the characters in the letter surrounded by the bounding boxes, this algorithm can also be trained for the classification of the custom digits, and we can implement that algorithm to identify digits in image.
	A novel class of machine learning techniques built on statistical learning theory is the support vector machine. Support vector machines have gained popularity among researchers in the machine learning community due to their improved accuracy. The real-world issues that an algorithm must solve to demonstrate its viability and the potential of support vector machines in categorization applications. Recent years have seen an increase in the practical application of robust theoretical foundations in academic research, as well as improvements in high dimension, local minima point, small sample, and nonlinear [8]. We are going to use the algorithm without using PCA and with PCA it is very essential to identify the performance with both the approach so that we can choose one of the approaches for the classification of the digit further we use the HOG feature to train the model will giving us better results.
	One of the most popular classification methods is the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) technique since it is straightforward and simple to apply. when there is little or no prior knowledge about the distribution of the data, classification should be one of the initial options for classification research. Classification is one of the most fundamental and basic classification procedures. The necessity to perform discriminant analysis when accurate parametric estimates of probability densities are unknown or challenging to ascertain led to the development of K-nearest-neighbour classification. Non-parametric techniques like the k-NN algorithm are frequently applied to classification and regression issues [10]. This kind of lazy learning algorithm does not require off-line training. This algorithm we have implemented in MATLAB to perform the desired approaches for the extracted features.
	Multiple models are used in ensemble approaches to improve performance. Numerous research areas, including data science, statistical data, and machine learning, have used ensemble approaches. A group of classifiers are built using ensemble methods, which categorise fresh data by weighing the predictions of the classifiers in a vote. Error-correcting output coding, Bagging, and boosting are more contemporary algorithms in addition to Bayesian averaging, the ensemble method's initial algorithm. Any path can be taken in a decision tree, which is a tree-based method. In this dissertation we also implement the decision tree algorithm just to compare with the other methods and give us clear visualization of the performance of the machine learning model [11]. We have conducted the background research on the machine learning method that we learned above and the feature extraction process and methods by using image vector and HOG feature as Training input and predict the data using the generated classifier.


HOG:

Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) is a feature descriptor. It is frequency employed to the creatures out of the image data it is commonly used for object detection in computer vision tasks perfect. Using this feature, we can easily convert the image into the HOG features. The process of computing HOG feature is processing the data, calculating the gradient and calculate the magnitude an orientation [19]. The complete process of the HOG feature descriptor are as follows
Pre-process the Data: in this part we have to segment the image to the number of parts into the rows and columns with same pixel height and width.
Calculating Gradients: Now we have to take each segment of the image and then compute the gradient of that segmented image which is mathematically given as
G_x (r,c)=I(r,c+1)-I(r,c-1)
G_y (r,c)=I(r-1,c)-I(r+1,c)
Calculating the magnitude and orientation of the image: computation of the magnitude and tan for the angle is given as
G=√(G_x^2+G_y^2 )
tan⁡(θ)=G_y/G_x
Calculate Histogram of Gradient and Normalization: now we have to compute the histogram of oriented gradient for each segment of image and normalize the gradient to get the feature of the complete image. The overall illumination has an impact on the image's gradients. As a result, for a given image, a component of the image would be noticeably brighter than the other portions.


Aim:


The main aim of the project is to create the Machine learning algorithm which can identify the digit dataset of the Greek letters, we are going to study and implement various machine learning technique on the dataset to get the higher accurate results, we are going to use the three different type of feature extraction process and train each feature with all the four machine learning techniques which is Support vector machine, K-Nearest neighbour, Ensemble and Decision tree classifier. We test the model with the test dataset and identify the best possible model to get the good accuracy in validation as well as testing dataset.

Dataset:

Greek letter pictures totalling 240 images make up the training dataset (10 for each letter). The test dataset has 96 photos in it (4 for each letter). The desire to test several machine learning approaches for classification on a dataset of lowercase Greek letters served as the driving force behind this effort. We are going to use high resolution image for the process of the feature extraction. Few points to consider while selection of the dataset as describing below.
•	Introduce the issue right away: You we can choose which data could be more beneficial to collect by having a clear idea of what you want to forecast. Data exploration and an attempt to think in terms of classification, clustering, regression, and ranking should be made when framing the problem.
•	Discretize dataset: If you convert numerical numbers to categorical values, we can make better predictions. By categorizing the complete range of values into various categories, this can be accomplished.
•	Reduce dataset: By breaking up the complete attribute data into various categories and calculating the number for each group, we may also minimize data by aggregating it into larger records. Instead of looking at the items that were most often bought that day
•	Complete data cleaning: Make this a top priority because missing values can cause predictions to be less accurate. In terms of machine learning, values that are assumed or roughly estimated are more appropriate for an algorithm than simply absent values. To fill the data, we must utilize MATLAB's fill missing function.
•	Checking quality of dataset: we have to check the label given for the specific feature is proper or not. We also have to make sure that the dataset is proper and able to import into the workspace.
•	Consistent format: The file format you're employing is another name for data formatting. And converting a dataset into the file format that works best for your machine learning system is not too difficult.

Feature Extraction:

The pre-processing of the image dataset is necessary as each image may be of different sizes and format so to make it standardize for the machine learning model, we have to extract the features from each image of the dataset. Extraction of the feature can be done based on the image which we are using as the feature, suppose if the image contains multiple objects, then we have to identify the object first then we have to extract of the feature. We have given the Greek letter images which is in white and black background, first we have to reduce the size of the image to 32 x 32 pixels, after that we have to binarize the image by thresholding the grayscale image and extracting the three feature which we are going to use in this project. The first one is the binary feature extraction it is the process in which the image is converted into the binary image first, contains the 1s and 0s values. Then we convert the binary scheme to the double to make it readable to the machine learning model. 


Training Model:

We are going to use four Machine learning models Support vector machine, k-nearest Neighbour, Ensemble and Decision tree algorithm to train the model for the recognition of the Greek digits having 24 classes, each class have 10 sets of images we are going to train the model for three proposed features binary vectors, PCA and HOG descriptor. We have to check the accuracy of the four model which is trained by using the input features for the analysis and the performance. We have computed the accuracy of the model and plot it on the bar chart to give better visualization and its better for the analysis and selection of model, we also show the time taken for each model to train so that it will given more depth idea. 

Conclusion:


We have first design the machine learning model for the recognition of the digit using Ensemble, KNN, SVM and Decision Tree classifier, by the training and testing we get accuracy greater than 98% which is great there are 2% or lesser chances getting the wrong prediction which is complete feasible for such digit recognition application, from the started with the creating the function algorithm which is used to  train the chosen machine learning model after that we extract the feature and show the progress of the extraction on the command window with the computational time for the processes which is incorporated in the MATLAB section. We test the dataset after the training of the model we found that the Ensemble and SVM model performs well with higher accuracy in the testing. The trained model is used for the prediction of the digit recognition on some samples of images and we displayed six random samples on the figure with the class label on the title. So, from the above results and observation we can say that we are successfully implement the machine learning model for the recognition of the Greek digit on which we see that HOG feature performs well among another feature extractor.
